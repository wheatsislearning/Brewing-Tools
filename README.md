# Brewing-Tools
Recipe Converter
#I am trying to create a few different programs that will help a brewer prepare and execute a brew day, such as recipe conversions, efficiency calculator, ABV calculator, and then a built in timer where you can input your recipe and then "start your 60 or 90 minute boil" and have the timer alert you when your HOP additions would be (ie. 60 min hop addition, 15 min hop, 5, min hop, 0 min flame out) and any other ingredients to go into the boil at specific times. 
#I know there are already free brewing softwares available, but I haven't been able to actually see the code there, I am still looking, I just wanted to make a little program to test my new skills at coding. 
#I am very new to writing code, I just started two weeks ago.
